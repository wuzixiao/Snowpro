  Security
    Role and Priviledge
      The built-in roles can NOT be dropped.
      The default privileges provided to the built-in roles can NOT be revoked.
      The ORGADMIN role performs organization-specific tasks like listing all accounts and creating new ones. ORGADMIN can also delete accounts if required.
  Time Travel
    Minimal editaion is Enterprise
  Data and License
    Database replication
      Minimal editaion is Enterprise
  Clone
    Named Internal Stages cannot be cloned.Named External Stages can be cloned.Table stages are cloned
    A cloned object does not inherit any privileges from its source object; for instance, a cloned table does not inherit any privileges from its source table. However, if a database or schema is cloned, privileges are inherited by the child objects.
    Temporary tables can NOT be cloned to a permanent table. However, a temporary table may be cloned to a transient table or another temporary table.
  Data Sharing
    Data can be shared, not user or account
    Any Snowflake account can share data and simultaneously consume data from another provider
  Architecture
    Scaling up/down
      Scaling down a virtual warehouse is typically done in reaction to reduced query complexity, where a smaller virtual warehouse can still perform queries efficiently and on time.
    Cache
      VM cache
      Metadata cache
      Query Result cache
    Cost
      Snowflake credits are billed per second; however, a minimum of 60 seconds of billing applies
    Functionality
      The Enterprise edition has several additional capabilities not provided in the Standard edition. These include **multi-cluster virtual warehouses, column-level masking, row access policies, materialized views, and search optimization.**
      ACCOUNTADMIN is the only role with the privileges required to **create & manage a share** because managing Share is an account-level activity.
    Cluster
      The following indicators can help determine if a clustering key may be needed. 路 The table has large volumes of data (e.g., multiple terabytes) 路 Queries on the table are running slower than expected. 路 Query performance has gotten worse over time. 路 The table has a large clustering depth

  Tasks
    Compute
      The largest compute size available for serverless tasks is equivalent to the capacity of an XXLARGE or 2X-Large user-managed virtual warehouse.
  Partners
    Business Intelligence Partners
      There are a lot of companies
  Performance Concepts
    Material view
      can be helpful if a query or slight variation is executed frequently.
      can pre-compute the results and speed up the processing.
      can be created on an external table to improve performance.
    Search optimization service 
      can be used to improve the performance of point lookup queries that return only one or a few rows, using highly selective filters using equality predicates or IN predicates.
      The search optimization service in Snowflake is similar to the **secondary index** concept in typical databases.
  Data Loading and Unloading
    Command
      Put: uploads data from an on-premises system to an internal stage.
      Get: download data from an internal stage to an on-premises system
    load metadata
      Stores a variety of information, such as the name of every file that was loaded into that table and the time stamp corresponding to the time that a file was loaded.
    Process
      During the load process, the COPY command allows for modifying the order of columns, omitting one or more columns, casting data into specified data types, and truncating values. While loading the data, complex transformations such as joins, filters, aggregations, and the use of FLATTEN are not supported as they are not essential data transformations.
  Account Usage & Monitoring
    Information Schema
      Typical data retention in INFORMATION SCHEMA is 14 days but can be seven days for specific views and up to 6 months for usage history views.
      Data provided by the ACCOUNT_USAGE views is NOT real-time and refreshes typically with a lag of **45 minutes to 3 hours**
  Extending Snowflake Functionality
    Secure UDF
      SQL UDFs should be created as secure if their purpose is to protect data, such as views that limit the rows returned to the user or the columns.
